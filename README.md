For process explanation;flowcharts and diagrams.
For representation;graphs,charts and tables
For spatial relationships;technical drawings, maps and floor plan.

## 9. How do headings and subheadings improve the readability and organization of technical documents?
Headings serve as signposts that guide readers through the document.
